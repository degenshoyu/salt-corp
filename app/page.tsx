        <p>
          In the aftermath of collapse — when networks fail, consensus breaks down, and authority disappears — can value still move?
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Can two strangers still make a trade — not through barter, but through a form of digital currency that requires no network communication?</strong>
          <br /><br />
          This is the question that led to the creation of SALT.
          <br /><br />
          <em>Not just as a coin —  but as an experiment.</em>

        <h2 className="text-red-400 text-lg md:text-xl font-bold uppercase mb-2">[NSC-H-0002] Justification: Why SALT Exists</h2>
        <p>
          Most digital currencies — especially blockchain-based ones — are not designed for collapse.
          <br /><br />
          They require validators.<br />
          They require global consensus.<br />
          They require uninterrupted network access.
          <br /><br />
          They assume coordination.<br />
          They assume communication.<br />
          They assume civilization.
          <br /><br />
          But what happens when all of that fails?<br />
          What happens after a nuclear war?<br />
          What happens when we are in outer space?
          <br /><br />
          SALT is not a better blockchain.<br />
          It is a rejection of the premise that blockchains are required.
          <br /><br />
          It is an attempt to preserve the ability to trade — even in isolation.<br />
          To move value — even when everything else has stopped.
          <br /><br />
          Each unit of SALT is not part of a ledger.<br />
          It is its own ledger.

        <h2 className="text-red-400 text-lg md:text-xl font-bold uppercase mb-2">[NSC-H-0003] Initiation: Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          To fund the experiment, we launched a memetic copy of SALT on Pump.fun: <strong>mSALT</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Contract Address:</strong> TBD
          <br /><br />
          mSALT is not the real thing.<br />
          But it’s your key to it.
          <br /><br />
          Stake it later to earn <strong>OG SALT</strong> — the original, signed-by-hand version issued by SALT Corp, one signature at a time.
          <br /><br />
          Only mSALT holders will access OG SALT.
          <br />
          <strong>Only OG SALT holders can enter the experiment.</strong>

        <p>
          The true nature of SALT cannot be tested in theory.
          <br /><br />
          It must be lived — in a controlled simulation:<br />
          a networked wasteland economy, where players must trade, scavenge, and survive without central authority.
          <br /><br />
          Every participant begins with limited SALT.<br />
          Only those who staked mSALT are allocated initial supplies.
          <br /><br />
          There is no central ledger.<br />
          No market oracle.<br />
          No guaranteed value.
          <br /><br />
          Each transfer is signed manually.<br />
          Each transaction is remembered.<br />
          Each fork must be explained — or fought over.
          <br /><br />
          Players will forge identity through transfer.<br />
          History through signature.<br />
          Reputation through behavior.
          <br /><br />
          There is no reset.<br />
          There is no admin.<br />
          Only the chain — carried forward, one signature at a time.
          <br /><br />
          Every trade is a message.<br />
          Every unit of SALT is proof you were there.
